//! # Intecture API
//!
//! The Intecture API is the interface between your code and your managed
//! hosts. The library is organised into a set of 'primitives', which
//! are the building blocks used to configure your systems.
//! Developers should implement these primitives in their source code
//! in order to configure and maintain their managed hosts.
//!
//! ## Communication
//!
//! The API communicates with the Agent service on your managed hosts
//! via a ZeroMQ "REQ" (REQuest) socket. No other socket types are
//! supported by the Intecture Agent.
//!
//! **Note:** The Agent service must be running when you call any
//! Intecture API primitives, or the program will hang while it
//! attempts to connect to a non-existent socket.
